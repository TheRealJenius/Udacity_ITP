Hello world, =)
Markup is a used to <em> define </em> text and references
<p>
    So far I've learned that <strong> p </strong> is for paragrahs and <strong> br </strong> is for linebreaks
</p>
Now <sub>this is my </sub>attempt at <sup>understanding sub and sup</sup><br>

Here's a list of things I've learned so far
<ol>
    <li> I need to add li to write a list</li>
    <li> I can write a list without a closing li tag 
    <li> There are two types of lists, Ordered (ol) and Unordered (ul)</li>
    <ul>
        <li> I can nest lists together</li>
        <li> regardless of the type of list</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
