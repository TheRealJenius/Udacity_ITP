        Hello world, =)
        Markup is a used to <em> define </em> text and references
        <p>
            So far I've learned that <strong> p </strong> is for paragrahs and <strong> br </strong> is for linebreaks
        </p>
        Now <sub>this is my </sub>attempt at <sup>understanding sub and sup</sup><br>

        Here's a list of things I've learned so far
        <ol>
            <li> I need to add li to write a list</li>
            <li> I can write a list without a closing li tag 
            <li> There are two types of lists, Ordered (ol) and Unordered (ul)
                <ul>
                    <li> I can nest lists together</li>
                    <li> regardless of the type of list</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        This time I learned about links and would like to show you <a href = "https://github.com/TheRealJenius"> my git hub page</a>
        Also here is the image I used on my github page:<br>

        I also just added a doc type tag at the top so the browser knows it uses modern HTMl
